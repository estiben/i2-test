StaffLister is a Web service written in Java which makes calls to the InSites Web Services API.
HTTP calls are made using the BasicClient class included in this package. You'll need to point 
this application at a running instance of the InSites Platform, which is a hard-coded value. A real
implementation would have this value defined somewhere else.

It retrieves a list of all locations which are 'floors', then allows a user to select among them.
