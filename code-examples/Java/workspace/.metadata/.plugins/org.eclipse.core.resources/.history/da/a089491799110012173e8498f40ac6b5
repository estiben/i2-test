StaffLister is a Java Servlet which makes calls to the InSites Web Services API.
HTTP calls are made using the BasicClient class included in this package. You'll need to point 
this application at a running instance of the InSites Platform, which is a hard-coded value. A real
implementation would have this value defined somewhere else.

It retrieves a list of all locations which are 'floors', then allows a user to select among them.
The servlet then gets all staff objects on the selected floor and displays them in a list, 5 at a time.

This application can be hosted directly from Eclipse using the Run-Jetty-Run plugin.
