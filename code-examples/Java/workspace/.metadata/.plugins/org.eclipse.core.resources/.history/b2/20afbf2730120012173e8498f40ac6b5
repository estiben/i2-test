RTLSDevice is an Android application which makes calls to the InSites Web Services API. The purpose 
is to demonstrate a third-party system relaying sensor information to the InSties Platform.

The application allows you to specify connection credentials, and the label of an existing sensor 
tracked by InSites, then do any of the following:

-simulate a sensor button press
-simulate a sensor changing locations
-send a low battery indication

The sensor provider name is hard-coded in the API calls as "other-rtls".
